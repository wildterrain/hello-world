This text represents my first change to a branch created from the master file.
The master file branch is called readme.
This branch is called readme-edits.
Once I'm happy with changes to this branch I'm going to hit the "commit" button to save them.

I'm guessing later on down the track if everything works out this branch will be merged back into the master branch.
This merge is done by opening a 'Pull Request" that the owner of the repository can  then merge into the master branch.
